# Photomerger
This is a crazy project that basically turned dnd spells into common photos that could be used to show what the spell is
The point of this is to create common symbology to attempt to create a book that can fully explain what all goes into spellcasting in dnd5e.
See the samples folder to see a sample output with an explanation and then the spell fully laid out.
